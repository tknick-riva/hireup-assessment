# Smart Inbox Engine - Assessment Starter

This is a starter template for the Smart Inbox Engine technical challenge. The project includes a .NET Web API backend and a vanilla JavaScript frontend.

```

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- A modern web browser
- A simple HTTP server (or use VS Code Live Server extension)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Restore dependencies and run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet run
   ```

3. The API will be available at:
   - HTTP: `http://localhost:5000`
   - HTTPS: `https://localhost:5001`
   - Swagger UI: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`

### 2. Frontend Setup

You have several options to run the frontend:

**Option A: Using VS Code Live Server**
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `client/index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"
4. The page will open at `http://127.0.0.1:5500` (or similar)

**Using Python HTTP Server**
```bash
cd client
python3 -m http.server 3000
# Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```


### 3. Testing the Application

1. Make sure both the backend and frontend are running
2. Open the frontend in your browser
3. You Should see Smart Inbox

## API Endpoint

### POST `/api/inbox/sort`

**Request Body:**
```json
[
  {
    "sender": "boss@company.com",
    "subject": "URGENT: Production DB Down",
    "body": "Please fix this immediately.",
    "receivedAt": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
    "isVIP": true
  }
]
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "sender": "boss@company.com",
    "subject": "URGENT: Production DB Down",
    "body": "Please fix this immediately.",
    "receivedAt": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
    "isVIP": true,
    "priorityScore": 95
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Antivirus Software

⚠️ **Warning:** Some antivirus software may interfere with the development server or block network connections. If you experience issues:

- The backend may not start or may be blocked from listening on ports 5000/5001
- Network requests between frontend and backend may be blocked
- Consider temporarily disabling your antivirus or adding exceptions for:
  - The project directory
  - Ports 5000, 5001, 3000, and 5500
  - The `dotnet` executable

### CORS Errors

If you see CORS errors in the browser console, make sure:
1. The backend is running
2. The frontend URL matches one of the allowed origins in `Program.cs`:
   - `http://localhost:3000`
   - `http://127.0.0.1:5500`
   - `http://localhost:5500`

If your frontend runs on a different port, update the CORS configuration in `server/Program.cs`.

### Backend Not Starting

- Ensure you have .NET 9 SDK installed: `dotnet --version`
- Try cleaning and rebuilding: `dotnet clean && dotnet build`

### Frontend Can't Connect

- Verify the backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Ensure the API_URL in `index.html` matches your backend URL

## Running Tests

Unit tests are located in `server/Tests/`. To run the tests:

You are to implement a set of tests that will demonstrate your code quality. Your tests should cover:

- **Core functionality**: Test the priority scoring logic with various email scenarios
- **Edge cases**: Handle boundary conditions, null inputs, and unusual data
- **Business rules**: Verify that scoring calculations match the requirements
- **Code coverage**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of your service layer

A dummy test (`TestSetup_ShouldPass`) is included to verify the test infrastructure is working. If this test fails after you add your own tests, you'll know it's something in your code that broke the build.

```bash
cd server/Tests
dotnet test
```
